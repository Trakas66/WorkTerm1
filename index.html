              <h3 id="Manulife">Manulife</h3>

                the company leverages software development, cloud computing, data analytics, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems,

            <div class="card p-4">
              <h3 id="Goals">Goals</h3>
              <p>&emsp;During my work term at Manulife as a Salesforce software developer intern, I set several goals aimed at enhancing my technical skills,
                problem-solving abilities, and communication. These goals were directly related to my job tasks and focused on making the most of my learning
                experience in a professional environment.
              <h5>Goals Related to Job Tasks:</h5>
                &emsp;My primary goal was to make a significant contribution to the Salesforce division at Manulife by focusing on flow development and migration.
                I planned to automate various business processes through the creation of multiple flows. I also sought to
                improve my problem-solving skills by implementing complex business logic using Salesforce tools, particularly flows and Apex. Additionally,
                I aimed to enhance my oral communication skills, ensuring I could articulate my ideas clearly in sprint meetings.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Skills I Wanted to Learn:</h5> &emsp;One of my key learning objectives was to gain a comprehensive understanding of Salesforce and its various
                functionalities. To achieve this, I intended to complete as many Trailhead training modules as possible and obtain Salesforce certifications,
                including Administrator and Platform Developer 1. I also wanted to dive deeper into Apex, Salesforce's programming language, and learn how to
                create custom flow components.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;These tasks were important for building a solid foundation in Salesforce development, which will benefit my next work experience by giving
                me practical experience with widely used tools in the industry. Mastering these technologies would not only enhance my technical capabilities
                but also provide me with certifications that demonstrate my proficiency.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Technologies I Wanted to Work With:</h5> &emsp;I was particularly interested in working with Salesforce Flows and Apex. Flows appealed to me
                because it allows developers to automate business processes visually, which I found to be a powerful way to simplify complex workflows.
                Apex was another focus area, as it enables more advanced customizations and integration with Salesforce. I chose these technologies because
                they are crucial to building and scaling Salesforce applications, and mastering them would give me an edge in my future career as a developer.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Reflections on Goals</h4>
                <h5>Completed Goals:</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Improving Problem-Solving Skills: I successfully achieved this goal by working on process automation and implementing complex flows.
                    Through this experience, I developed my ability to handle tricky business logic and gained confidence in using Salesforce tools.</li>
                  <li>Enhancing Communication Skills: By regularly participating in sprint planning and stand-up meetings, I became more comfortable
                    articulating my ideas. I was able to communicate my progress and next steps clearly, with minimal follow-up questions from the team.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Unsuccessful Goals:</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Contributing to the Salesforce Division: My goal of achieving 5-10 sprint points in the first two sprints was not accomplished. In retrospect,
                    this was not an ideal goal since sprint points are assigned based on task complexity and team priorities, which were out of my control.</li>
                  <li>Obtaining Certifications: While I did manage to obtain the Administrator and Platform App Builder certifications by July 26, I was unable
                    to achieve the Platform Developer 1 certification within the timeframe. The certification required more preparation than I anticipated, and
                    I shifted my focus to other relevant skills for my role.</li>
                  <li>Learning to Create Flow Elements with Apex: I did not achieve this goal, as I became more focused on learning skills directly related to
                    my work tasks. Custom flow components were not immediately required, so I prioritized other learning areas.</li>
                </ol>
                &emsp;Overall, I made significant progress in several areas, despite not meeting all of my initial goals. The experience allowed me to gain
                practical knowledge in Salesforce development while enhancing both my technical and soft skills.
